\section{Goals and Definitions}
Goal: To understand the following questions: 
\begin{itemize}[$-$]
  \item What are systematic uncertainties?
  \item How do we correctly evaluate them?
  \item How do we know if all systematics have been accounted for?
  \item How do we treat correlations between systematic uncertainties?
  \item How do we combine them?
\end{itemize}

In practice, no systematic and coherent treatment is available or possible. We can only refer to knowledge, experience, common and sense and intuition. \marginnote{This is more a draft of a cookbook than a mathematical explanation. I will explain 
the main cooking techniques and a few recipes, but you have to explore on your own.}

\subsection{Definition of systematic uncertainties}
Possible definitions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Systematic uncertainties are all uncertainties that are not directly due to the statistics of the data. 
    \begin{itemize}[$\to$]
      \item With this definition, the trigger efficiency or detector acceptance obtained from MC simulations would be systematic errors, even though they have a statistical behaviour.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Systematic uncertainties are measurement errors which are not due to statistical fluctuations of real or simulated data samples.
    \begin{itemize}[$\to$]
      \item In this case, the trigger efficiency or detector acceptance would be treated as a statistical uncertainty. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
