\section{Goal \todo{what is goal} Confidence Interval} \label{sec:interval_estimation_goal_conf_interval}
In interval estimation, we want to find the range $\theta_a \leq \theta \leq \theta_b$ which contains the true value $\theta_0$ with probability $\beta$. Such interval is called "confidence interval" with probability content $\beta$. Typically, we choose $\beta=68.3\%$ and call it $1$ standard deviation error. However, the $68\%$ interval corresponds to $\pm$ standard deviation only for a Gaussian distribution.

Given an observation $x$ from a PDF $f(x|\theta)$, the probability content $\beta$ of the region $[a,b]$ in $x$-space is:
\begin{align}
    \beta = P(a \leq x \leq b) = \int \limits_a^b f(x|\theta) dx
\end{align}
If $f(x|\theta)$ and the parameter $\theta$ are known, one can always compute $\beta$ given $a$ and $b$.

If the parameter $\theta$ is unknown, we need to find another variable $z=z(x,\theta)$, such that the PDF of $z$ is independent of $\theta$:
\begin{align}
    f(z|x,\theta) = f(z|x)
\end{align}
If this can be found, we can find the optimal range $[\theta_a, \theta_b]$ in $\theta$-space such that:
\begin{align}
    P(\theta_a < \theta < \theta_b) = \beta
\end{align}

This interval $[\theta_a, \theta_b]$ is called a "confidence interval".

A method which yields such an interval $[\theta_a, \theta_b]$ is said to possess the property of "coverage".

\newthought{Notice that} 
\begin{itemize}[$\to$]
    \item $\theta_0$ is an unknown constant 
    \item $\theta_a$ and $\theta_b$ are functions of $x$, not of $\theta$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Confidence intervals for the mean of a Gaussian} \label{conf_int_mean_of_gaussian}
For any Gaussian, we can redefine $z=\dfrac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$, which is a standard-normal variable. 
\begin{align}
    f(z) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp{\Big [ - \dfrac{z^2}{2}\Big]}
\end{align}
Estimating the interval $[c,d]$ so that $P(c\leq z \leq d) = \beta$ is equivalent to finding $[z_\alpha, z_{\alpha+\beta}]$.

\todo{plot and table need to be inserted}

\subsection{Confidence intervals for several parameters} \label{conf_int_several_param}
Suppose we have an $n$-dimensional Gaussian:
\begin{align}
    f(\vec{x}|\vec{\theta}) = \dfrac{1}{(2\pi)^{\frac{n}{2}} \sqrt{|C|}} \exp \Big[- \frac{1}{2} (\vec{x}-\vec{\theta})^T C^{-1} (\vec{x} - \vec{\theta})\Big]
\end{align}
Each $x_i$ is normal, therefore $Q(\vec{x}, \vec{\theta}) = (\vec{x}-\vec{\theta})^T C^{-1} (\vec{x}-\vec{\theta})$ is a $\chi^2(n)$ distribution, and does not depend on $\vec{\theta}$.
\begin{align}
    Q(\vec{x}, \vec{\theta}) = Q(\vec{x})
\end{align}

\subsection{Second derivative matrix} \label{second_derivative_matrix}
Assume $\vec{x}$ has an $n$-dimensional Gaussian PDF. 

One can prove that the $n$-dim covariance matrix $C$ can be obtained from the inverse of the $2$nd order partial derivative matrix of $-\ln\mathcal{L}$:
\begin{align}
    C_{ij}^{-1} = - \dfrac{\partial \ln \mathcal{L}(\vec{x}|\vec{\theta})}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}
\end{align}
This covariance matrix gives an $n$-dim elliptic contour with the correct coverage only if the PDF is exactly Gaussian!

This is the "standard" classical method used to compute uncertainties in common fitting algorithms, e.g., Migrad/\todo{what is this} of Minuit/\texttt{ROOT}.

\subsection{Log-likelihood scan} \label{log_likelihood_scan}
Another common method consists of taking a scan of $-2\ln\mathcal{L}$ around its minimum value, $-2\ln\mathcal{L}_{max}$.

$\to$ For a Gaussian $1$-dim distribution:
\begin{align}
    \ln\mathcal{L}(x|\mu) &= \ln C - \dfrac{(\mu - x)^2}{2\sigma^2} \quad \implies \text{parabola in $\mu$} \\
    \to -2 \ln \mathcal{L} &= -2 \ln \mathcal{L}_{max} + \dfrac{(\mu - x)^2}{\sigma^2}
\end{align}
The intercept at $-2 \ln \mathcal{L}_{max} = -2\ln \mathcal{L}_{max} + 1$ provides the $\pm1\sigma$ interval. 

The intercept at $+4$ provides the $\pm2\sigma$, and so on. \todo{parabola needs to be added}

\subsection{$\mathcal{L}$ scan in dim$>1$: Profile likelihood} \label{l_scan_profile_likelihood}
For dim$>1$ we have: 
\begin{align}
    \ln \mathcal{L}_{\vec{\theta}}(\vec{x}|\vec{\theta}) &= \ln\mathcal{L}_{max} - \dfrac{1}{2} \chi^2_\beta(n) \\
    \to -2 \ln \mathcal{L}(\vec{x}|\vec{\theta}) &= -2\ln\mathcal{L}_{max} + \chi^2_\beta(n)
\end{align}
In principle, we can compute the contours: 
\todo{contours need to be added}

\newthought{Notice that}
\begin{itemize}[$\to$]
    \item The inner contour is more nearly elliptical than the outer ones.
    \item The coverage is improved with respect to the Gaussian approximation. 
    \item This is still an approximation valid for large $n$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Variance of transformed variables, aka Error propagation} \label{error_prop}
Suppose we have a variable $\vec{x}$ with a given PDF and mean $\vec{\mu}$ and variance $V(\vec{x})$.

Suppose we want to compute the variance of the transformed variable $y=y(\vec{x})$, and that the function can be expanded in Taylor series around $\vec{\mu}$:
\begin{align}
    y(\vec{x}) = y(\vec{\mu}) + \sum \limits_i (x_i - \mu_i) \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial \mu_i} + \cdots
\end{align}
The expectation value of $y$ is: $\overline{y} = y(\vec{\mu})$

The variance is: 
\begin{align}
    V(y) &= E[y-E(y)]^2 \\
    &\approx E\Big [\sum\limits_i (x_i - \mu_i) \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial x_i}\Big]^2 \\
    &\approx \sum\limits_i \sum\limits_j \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial x_i} \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial x_j} E[(x_i - \mu_i)(x_j - \mu_j)] \\
    &\approx \sum\limits_{i,j} \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial x_i} \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial x_j} \mathrm{Cov}(x_i, x_j)
\end{align}

\subsection{Confidence intervals for any PDF: Ordering rules} \label{confidence_int_ordering_rules}
The approximation of $-2\ln\mathcal{L}$ with a Gaussian or its excursion around its minimum guarantee an exact coverage only for a small set of cases, and in particular, for large $n$.

Here, we will see a general approach. 

Suppose we have a variable $x$ with PDF $f(x|\theta)$. In general, $f$ is not symmetric, so we need to decide how to compute an interval corresponding to some predefined probability content $\beta$. 

\begin{itemize}[$\to$]
    \item Central interval
    \begin{align}
    [x_L(\theta), x_U(\theta)] = [\overline{x}(\theta)-\delta, \overline{x}(\theta + \delta)]
\end{align}
Here, $\overline{x}$ could be the mean or the mode.  \todo{need to add plots}
\item Equal areas 
\begin{align}
    \int \limits_{-\infty}^{x_L} f(x|\theta) dx = \int \limits_{x_U}^{\infty}f(x|\theta) dx = \dfrac{1-\beta}{2}
\end{align} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Neyman confidence belt}
Take a variable $x$ with PDF $f(x|\theta)$ and $\theta$ unknown. Suppose $t(x)$ is some function of the data. We can write: 
\begin{align}
    \beta &= P(t_1 \leq t \leq t_2) = P (t_1(\theta) \leq t \leq t_2(\theta)) \\
    &= \int\limits_{t_1}^{t_2} f(t|\theta) dt 
\end{align}
Assume that we have a way to determine $t_1$ and $t_2$ for each value of $\theta$. Such values form two curves in the $(t,\theta)$ space. \todo{add plot}

The space between the curves is called the "Neyman confidence belt".

From this belt, given a specific measured value $t_0$, we want to extract an interval on the parameter $\theta$. 

Suppose $\theta_0$ is the true, unknown value of $\theta$. If we repeat the measurement many times, a fraction $\beta$ of the measurements will fall in $[t_1(\theta_0), t_2(\theta_0)]$ by definition. \todo{Add plot}

The corresponding belt would be: \todo{add plot}

For some values of $\mu$, e.g., $\mu=2.5$, we have a coverage of $85\%$ only!

\newthought{Notice that} 
\begin{itemize}[$\to$]
    \item The coverage is a property of the method, not of a particular interval. 
    \item The flip-flopping issue arises from the fact that our ordering rule depends on the outcome of the measurement. 
    \marginnote{Feldman and Cousins showed that this should not be done!}
\end{itemize}

Example: flip-flopping

Examples: \begin{itemize}[$\to$]
    \item FC belt for Gaussian 
    \item FC belt for electron neutron mass
\end{itemize}

\subsection{FC belt calculation for Gaussian} 
Recall the flip-flopping case, where we had $x$ with a PDF: 
\begin{align}
    f(x|\mu) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp \Big[- \dfrac{(x-\mu)^2}{2}\Big]
\end{align}
The value $\hat{\mu}$ that maximizes $f(x|\mu)$ given some measured $x$ is: 
\begin{align}
    \hat{\mu}(x) = \max\{x,0\}
\end{align}
The PDF for $x$, using the $\max \mathcal{L}$ estimate for $\mu$ is: 
\begin{align}
    f(x|\hat{\mu}(x)) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{lcl}
       \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}  & & {\textrm{if } x \geq 0} \\
        \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\Big[-\dfrac{x^2}{2}\Big] & & {\textrm{if } x < 0} 
    \end{array} \right.
\end{align}
The likelihood ratio becomes: 
\begin{align}
    \lambda(x|\mu) = \dfrac{f(x|mu)}{f(x|\hat{\mu}(x))} = \left\{
    \begin{array}{lcl}
         \exp\Big[ -\dfrac{(x-\mu)^2}{2}\Big]& & {\textrm{if } x \geq 0}  \\
         \exp\Big[x\mu - \dfrac{\mu^2}{2}\Big]& & {\textrm{if } x < 0}
    \end{array} \right.
\end{align}
At this point, we can find the interval $[\mu_1, \mu_2]$ numerically for any value of $\mu$. The result will be: 
\todo

If $(1)$ and $(2)$ give different results:
\begin{itemize}[$\to$]
    \item If the number of parameters is small ($\approx2$), Feldman-Cousins is easy to implement. 
    \item If the number of parameters os $\geq 3$, FC might become very complicated or CPU intensive, but in these situations, typically the profile-$\mathcal{L}$ method provides good coverage. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coverage calculation}
In any case, one should make sure the method provides the desired coverage! 

This can be done as follows: 
\begin{itemize}[$\to$]
    \item Assume values for each parameter, generate $\geq 10^4$ toy-MC experiments, count how many times the confidence interval covers the true value of each parameter. 
    \item Repeat for different values of the parameters.
\end{itemize}
