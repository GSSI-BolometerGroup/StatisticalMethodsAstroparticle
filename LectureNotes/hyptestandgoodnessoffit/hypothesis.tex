\section{Hypothesis testing} \label{hypothesis_testing}
Goals: \begin{itemize}[$\to$]
    \item Use data to verify or disprove theory or hypothesis
    \item Choose between alternative hypotheses 
\end{itemize}

Simple hypothesis: Hypothesis which is completely specified, e.g., theoretical model and parameter values 

Composite hypothesis: Ensemble of more than one simple hypotheses, e.g., model with free parameters (equivalent to infinite list of hypotheses for all possible values of the parameter).\\


Goals: 
\begin{itemize}[$\to$]
    \item Take 
    \begin{itemize}[$\to$]
        \item $H_0$ as the null hypothesis (background)
        \item $H_1$ as the alternative hypothesis (signal + background)
        \item $H_0$ and $H_1$ are a complete set $\implies \: P(H_0)+P(H_1) = 1$ (Bayesian) 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Test of hypothesis: Use data to verify/disprove $H_0$ or $H_1$
\end{itemize}
