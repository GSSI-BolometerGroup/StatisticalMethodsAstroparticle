\section{History}

\begin{itemize}[$\to$]
    \item The concept of probability was mathematically formalized by Andrey~N.~Kolmogorov in 1933 with \emph{``Foundations of the Theory of Probability''}\cite{Kolmogorov1933,Kolmogorov1956}.
    \item Many concepts and theorems were already known before, even if they had not been fully integrated into a coherent theory yet; \eg Bayes' theorem dates back to the 18\textsuperscript{th} century.
\end{itemize}
