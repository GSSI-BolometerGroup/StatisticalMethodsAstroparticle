\section{History}


\begin{fullwidth}
The concept of probability was formalized by Andrey Kolmogorov in 1933 with ''Foundation of the Theory of Probability". Many concepts and theorems were already known before, even if they had not been fully integrated in a coherent theory yet. For example, the Bayes theorem dates back to the 18th century.
